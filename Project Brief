# Weather-station-data-analysis
Code and report on the analysis of a weather station using MATLAB


Using the programming language MATLAB, I set out to see if I could extract some meaningful information from a weather station in the UK. I had a look at the data gathered throughout the year which contained a reading for temperature and humidity every 5 minutes throughout a year. As you can imagine, this was a lot of data with over 100,000 data points so using excel would have been ineffective. I managed to plot daily temperature and humidity variations, as well as the mean temperature and humidity throughout the year. 
This project involved:
-	Combining 4 spreadsheets into one on MATLAB to make analysis more efficient
-	Creating functions to go through all 100,000 datapoints automatically using if, else functions as well as for loops
-	Implementing multiple regression using matrices to predict trends in temperature and humidity
-	Using correlation coefficients to determine the relationship between temperature and humidity
-	Converting the polar coordinates into cartesian.
-	Creating a 50-page report detailing the outcomes of the project
